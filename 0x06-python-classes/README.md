### CLASSES AND OBJECTS IN PYTHON
In python , classes and objects are concepts of object oriented programming (OOP) that allow us to create reusable structures to represent entities or concepts in one's code

#### The Requirements
- The allowed editors are emacs, vi and vim
- First line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Files must be executable
- Length of your files will be tested using wc
- your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- codes should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

#### The Tasks
- an empty class Square that defines a square
- class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)
- class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)
- a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py)
- a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)
- a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)
- class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)
