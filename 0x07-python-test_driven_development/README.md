### TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT IN PYTHON
This involves the practice of writing tests before writing your own code. Through this process the code is thoroughly tested and becomes reliable when using.

#### Requirements in Python scripts
- The allowed editors are vi, vim and emacs
- First line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file is a must at the root of the folder
- All your files must be executable
- Files should end with a new line

#### The test cases
- The files should be in the folder called tests
- The test files should be test files with extension .txt
- Tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
- Functions should have a documentation
- Modules should have a documentation 
- Tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*

#### The tasks
- function that adds 2 integers.
- function that divides all elements of a matrix.
- function that prints My name is <first name> <last name>
- function that prints a square with the character #.
- function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and
