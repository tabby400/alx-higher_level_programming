Here we are learning on http which is the most popular protocol used in the internet.HTTP is a pull protocol, whereby client pulls information from the server (instead of server pushes information down to the client).HTTP is a stateless protocol. In other words, the current request does not know what has been done in the previous requests.When you issue a URL from your browser to get a web resource using HTTP, e.g. http://www.nowhere123.com/index.html, the browser turns the URL into a request message and sends it to the HTTP server. The HTTP server interprets the request message, and then returns you a r`esponse message, which is either the resource you requested or an error message
