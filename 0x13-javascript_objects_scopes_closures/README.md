#### OBJECTS, SCOPES AND CLOSURES IN JAVASCRIPT
An object can be seen as a container that holds data such as properties and functions(methods). Scope is the context in which the variables and the functions are defined and how they can be accessed. A closure is when a function is created inside another function and retains access to the outer function's variables even after the outer function has finished executing
