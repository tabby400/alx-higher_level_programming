Python is known to have data structures used when it comes to organizing and manipulating data. The data structures include lists, dictionaries and sets which are mutable and tuples which are immutable

- First line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- Length of the codes are tested using wc
- Your files must be executable
- Must have a README.md file at the root of the folder of your project

#### Tasks
- Function that prints all integers of a list.
- Function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
- Function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
- Function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
- Function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
- Function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
- Function that prints a matrix of integers.
- Function that adds 2 tuples.
- Function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
- Function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
- Function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
- Function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
