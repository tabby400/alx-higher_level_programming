#### INHERITANCE IN PYTHON
This is a concept in Object Oriented Programming which allows one to create new classes that are based on already existing classes.There can be a single inheritance or multiple inheritance where a class inherits from multiple superclasses

##### The Requirements
- The allowed editors are emacs, vi and vim
- All files should end with a new line
- A readme.md file at the root of the project is mandatory
- Your files must be executable
- First line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Length of your files will be tested using wc

##### The tasks
- function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object
- class MyList that inherits from list
- function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False
- function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False 
- function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False
- an empty class BaseGeometry
- class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py).
- class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py).
- a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py).
- a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py). (task based on 8-rectangle.py)
- class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py)
- class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py). (task based on 10-square.py).
